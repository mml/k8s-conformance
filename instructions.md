# How to submit conformance results

## The tests

The standard set of conformance tests is currently those defined by the
`[Conformance]` tag in the
[kubernetes e2e](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/e2e)
suite.

## Running

The standard tool for running these tests is
[sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy), and the standard way to run
these in your cluster is with `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/master/sonobuoy-conformance-1.7.yaml | kubectl apply -f -`.

Watch sonobuoy's logs with `kubectl logs -f -n sonobuoy sonobuoy` and wait for
the line `no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking`.  At this point, use
`kubectl cp` to bring the results to your local machine, expand the tarball, and
retain `plugins/e2e/results/{e2e.log,junit.xml}`.
